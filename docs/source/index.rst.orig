Overview
========

The ``utils3`` library is a collection of commonly used Python 3.5+ 
utilities. These utilities include (but are certainly not limit to) 
database connection classes, colourmaps, JSON config file loading, 
program event logging, error reporting, console user interface, etc.

``utils3`` is a Python 3.5+ continuation of the discontinued Python 2.7
``utils`` package, which ended with v6.1.5.
